# Cleaning

This part of Allie's skills relates to data cleaning.

Data cleansing is the process of making clean datasets - like removing noise in audio files. It allows for data with a higher signal-to-noise ratio for modeling, increasing robustness of models.

Common data cleaning things include
- class auto balance (this is done by default in the model.py script)
- removing file duplicates 
- normalizing volume in the audio files
