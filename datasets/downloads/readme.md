# Downloads 

Allie can also download data for you to prepare datasets for machine learning.

## Getting started 

All you need to do is call Allie's download script:
```
cd allie/datasets/downloads
python3 download.py 
```

You will then be prompted through a few screens as to what kinds of data you are seeking to download. 

```
what type of data would you like to download? (1-audio, 2-text, 3-image, 4-video, 5-csv)

Great, I have you downloading the AudioSet dataset. This may take some time (up to 2 days), as it it estimated to be >20GB in size.

For a complete list of datasets, visit the main datasets page. Note all these and more are included in the download.py script. Some datasets you may need to sign up for research access, so they cannot be directly downloaded within this interface; however, we may have them intenrally within the NeuroLex team. Just ask us :-)
