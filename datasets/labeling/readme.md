# Labeling

Allie also has data labeling.

Data labeling is the process of tagging data with useful information. For example, determining whether a speaker is a male or a female.

This allows for data to be modeled as classification problems (labels are binary or [1,2,3,4,...N]) or regression problems (labels are [0:1]).
