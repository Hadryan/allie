## Archived modeling techniques 

I tried a wide range of autoML libraries. These did not make the cut for these reasons. 

* '[autokeras](https://autokeras.com/)' - automatic optimization of a neural network using neural architecture search (takes a very long time). (cannot make predictions from MLP models trained... WTF?) ðŸ‘Ž 
* '[autosklearn](https://github.com/automl/auto-sklearn)' - added to pip3 installation + script. (segmentation faults are common, thus archived. If documentation and community improves, may be good to add back in). ðŸ‘Ž 
* '[pLDA](https://github.com/RaviSoji/plda)' - this works only for symmetrical images (as it cannot compute eigenvector for many of the feature arrays we have created). For this reason, it is probably not a good idea to use this as a standard training method. ðŸ‘Ž 

Note that as the documentation and support for these libraries becomes better over time, it may make sense to move them into production.

They just don't work now :-)
