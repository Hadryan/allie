## Train directory 

Use this directory to train machine learning models based on folders of files.

Files can take form:

| File type | extension | how to train | 
| ------------- |-------------| -------------| 
| audio file | .WAV, .MP3 | classify multiple folders of .WAV files (e.g. male and female folders) | 
| text file | .TXT | classify multiple folders of .TXT files (e.g. wiki vs. transcription) | 
| image file | .PNG, .JPG | classify multiple folders of image files (e.g. dog vs. cat) | 
| video file | .MP4 | classify multiple folders of video files (e.g. walking vs. running) | 
| numerical data / categorical data | .CSV | classify multiple .CSV files in 2 separate folders (e.g. accepted vs. not accepted as an application candidate) | 

This falls in line with Ludwig data types.
