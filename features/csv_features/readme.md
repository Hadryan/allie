### CSV WIP

Perhaps rename CSV to tabular data type instead? 

* be able to determine file type and featurize accordingly on local path ./img.jpg ,./audio.wav, ./video.mp4, ./text.txt, etc.; these will then be featurized with default featurizers for images, audio, video, and text accordingly.
* accomodate all types on ludwig (https://uber.github.io/ludwig/getting_started/) - binary, numerical, category, set, bag, sequence, text, timeseries, image
* [seglearn](https://github.com/dmbee/seglearn) - time series pipeline.
