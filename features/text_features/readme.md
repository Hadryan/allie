### Text WIP
* [blabla](https://github.com/novoic/blabla) - NLP library for clinical assessment
* [bigrams-trigrams](https://www.sttmedia.com/syllablefrequency-english#trigrams) - add in bigrams/trigrams
* [keras-bert](https://github.com/CyberZHG/keras-bert)
* [Flair](https://github.com/flairNLP/flair)
* [textacy](https://chartbeat-labs.github.io/textacy/build/html/index.html) - from references
* [jellyfish](https://github.com/jamesturk/jellyfish) - distance measurements 
* [text2image](https://github.com/mansimov/text2image) - create an image from a sentence
* [stylemetry](https://github.com/jpotts18/stylometry) - many features around lexical richness
* [Swivel](https://github.com/bigiceberg/models/tree/master/swivel) - Google team
* [summerize](https://github.com/junaidiiith/TextSummerizer/blob/master/summerizer.py) - misspelled but many text features
* BERT pre-trained model - add through Ludwig
* Allen NLP pre-trained models.
* [coreNLP](https://stanfordnlp.github.io/stanfordnlp/) - stanfordNLP parser and featurizer
* [pytorch-transformers](https://github.com/huggingface/pytorch-transformers) - a lot of pre-trained models that could be useful for featurizations (e.g. BERT and other model types here).
* allow Ludwig model type to dictate featurization (.JSON files --> .CSV images). - 'text_ludwig_features'
* follow up with Larry on semantic coherence vector / value 
* add in text transcription (as the default value) 
* input text files
